## Purpose
An corporations application to show potential clients an overview of the company of QualiTrees. This platform is the companies business card, allowing users to learn more about QualiTrees and why it is a successful and reliable business for everyday cannabis use.

## Features
When the user loads the site, they view a homepage with the QualiTrees logo in the center that has animated floating logos on either side titled: About Us, Products, Wisdom, and FAQ. When the user clicks on one of the logos, then the menu shifts upward and shrinks, becoming the websites navigation bar and revealing that tabs information underneath. When the user hovers over the main center logo, it appears to shine. When clicked, it brings the user back to the home page.

The About Us tab displays texts describing the company. The Products tab displays the companies products and how to purchase them. The Wisdom tab displays the benefits of cannabis. The FAQ tab has accordian style menu where when a tab is clicked, it displays text and closses all other tabs in the accordion.

There is also a footer at the bottom of all the pages where uses can find ways to contact the company, as well as find their storefront and address.
